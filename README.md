## What is this?
When creating enterprise mobile apps you need to consider a lot more than Hello World: how can you structure your code, how do you cope with connectivity problems, what if you don’t have a connection at all, how can you show your data faster,…
This repository might be a start after your "Hello World with Xamarin" is over.

Because I wanted to show you a working example, this repository contains a Xamarin.Forms app that shows your GitHub repositories.
